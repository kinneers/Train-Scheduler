The user interface is fairly straightforward: 
- To add a train, simply enter it's name, destination, first train time (in military time), and frequency in minutes- then click submit.
- There is no need for you to calculate the next arrival time or how many minutes away the train is now- that is all done for you!
- To remove a train from the list, simply click the 'remove' button at the end of that train's row.
- Each minute, the 'Next Arrival' and 'Minutes Away' columns will automatically update.
